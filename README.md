In this project I have compiled delay of trains of NJ Transit using libraries numpy, pandas, matplotlib to visualize the data and descriptive statistics of data.

STEPS INCLUDED:

1. Importing Libraries
2. Reading csv file 
3. Displaying statistical data 
4. Converting the "scheduled_time" and "actual_time" columns to datetimes
5. Grouping train according to train Id and date 
6. Analysis of july month
7. Function to plot pie charts with matplotlib   
8. Drop all the Amtrak values in each month   
9. Group by train ID and date 
10.Counting delay minutes from data greater than zero 
11.Converting delay minutes into list 
12.Displaying per month delays 
13.Displaying July delays 
14.Status of trains in July 
15.Most delayed lines in July 
16.Number of trips for each line
