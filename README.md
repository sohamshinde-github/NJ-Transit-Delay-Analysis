## NJ-Transit-Delay-Analysis

### In this project I have compiled delay of trains of NJ Transit using libraries numpy, pandas, matplotlib to visualize the data and descriptive statistics of data.

#### STEPS INCLUDED:

1. Importing Libraries</br>
2. Reading csv file</br> 
3. Displaying statistical data </br>
4. Converting the "scheduled_time" and "actual_time" columns to datetimes</br>
5. Grouping train according to train Id and date</br> 
6. Analysis of july month</br>
7. Function to plot pie charts with matplotlib  </br> 
8. Drop all the Amtrak values in each month </br>  
9. Group by train ID and date </br>
10. Counting delay minutes from data greater than zero </br>
11. Converting delay minutes into list </br>
12. Displaying per month delays </br>
13. Displaying July delays </br>
14. Status of trains in July </br>
15. Most delayed lines in July </br>
16. Number of trips for each line </br>
