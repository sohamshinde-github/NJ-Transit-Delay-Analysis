Read csv file -

Displaying statistics Dataset data

Converting the "scheduled_time" and "actual_time" columns to datetimes

Counting the  delay minutes from data greater than zero -

Converting the delay minutes into list -

Displays per month delays -

Displays pie chart -

Displays July delays -

Status of trains in july -
